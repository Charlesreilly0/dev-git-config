## üìù License

This project is released under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for details.

## üí° Tips

1. Use `git -h <command>` to see what any alias does
2. `git openrepo` works with both HTTPS and SSH remote URLs
3. The pretty log (`git lg`) is great for visualizing branch history
4. Use `git pf` instead of `git push -f` for safer force pushing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Backup Reminder

Before installing, the script will create new Git configurations. While it shouldn't override your existing aliases, it's always good practice to backup your existing `.gitconfig` file:

```bash
cp ~/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig.backup
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Command not found**: Make sure you've sourced your shell configuration:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc for Bash
   ```

2. **openrepo not working**: Ensure you have a valid remote URL:
   ```bash
   git remote -v  # Check your remote URLs
   ```

3. **Alias conflicts**: Check for existing aliases:
   ```bash
   git config --get-regexp alias  # List all aliases
   ```
